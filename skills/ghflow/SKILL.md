description: Prepare GitHub issues, implement selected issues, review changes, submit PRs, address feedback, and coordinate explicitly requested delivery. Use for Git and GitHub project workflow tasks. Merge requires explicit authorization; do not select backlog work unless requested.

# GitHub workflow

Select the requested operation and follow its task reference. Each operation works on an ordinary issue or PR without earlier ghflow tasks. Load only the task and shared rules needed now.

## Locate the source and tools

Resolve this `SKILL.md` path through any symbolic link. Its parent is `GHFLOW_SKILL_DIR`. Use absolute paths below that directory for references and subagent handoffs. Set `GHFLOW_CLI` to the absolute path of `scripts/ghflow.py` below it before running command examples. Quote the path:

```sh
GHFLOW_CLI="ABSOLUTE_SKILL_DIRECTORY/scripts/ghflow.py"
python3 "$GHFLOW_CLI" --help
```

Replace `ABSOLUTE_SKILL_DIRECTORY` with the resolved directory. Keep the full source checkout available: the launcher resolves `cli/ghflow.py` from its own file path. It preserves the current directory, so run Git and GitHub commands from the target project. Resolve writing guidance through each reference's links, not through the current directory. If source reads need external directory permission, report the resolved checkout path and use the setup instructions in [Source access permissions](../../README.md#source-access-permissions). Do not silently change agent permissions.

Apply [Authorization](references/shared/authorization.md) and [Evidence](references/shared/evidence.md). Before a subagent runs Git or GitHub commands, apply [Agent identity](references/shared/identity.md). CLI reads do not grant permission to write.

## Select the requested operation

Match the user's explicit request to the operation below. If a material input or endpoint is unclear, ask only for that decision. Do not choose backlog work or add a fixed sequence. A delivery request defaults to review follow-up with its PR left open. Read its coordinator reference for subagent dispatch and different-model review requirements.

## Execute and hand off

Follow the selected reference's scope and stopping point. Carry existing authorization across included tasks. Draft-only and read-only limits still apply; implementation or submission never implies merge permission.

For delegation, give the subagent the resolved entry skill path, selected task-reference path, resolved CLI path, target checkout, subject, revisions, evidence, decisions, and authorization limits. Tell it to execute that operation without selecting another. If delegation or the required reviewer model is unavailable, follow the shared rules and report the limit.

Return the operation's actual result, sources, checks, and remaining decisions. Report missing capabilities and incomplete evidence explicitly.
