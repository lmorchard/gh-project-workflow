# Setup

Install `ghflow` from a full checkout of this repository.
The agent uses this source checkout while it works in a target project.

## Requirements

Install Git, Python 3, and GitHub CLI (`gh`) in the agent environment.
Keep a local checkout of the target project for code investigation.
A command-line interface (CLI) accepts commands in a terminal.
The standard-library CLI in [cli/ghflow.py](../cli/ghflow.py) handles repeatable operations.
It uses existing Git and `gh` commands for other work.

Observed on 2026-10-09 while running `make check`: Python 3.14.7 and GitHub CLI 2.101.0.
These are observed versions, not minimum supported versions.

### Operation requirements

- Reading: [reconsider-issue](../references/tasks/reconsider-issue.md) needs a target checkout, source access, and permitted GitHub reads.
- Implementation: [implement-issue](../references/tasks/implement-issue.md) makes local commits. Subagents use the configured [machine identity](../references/shared/identity.md) and need target repository access for Git and GitHub commands.
- Coordinated delivery: [express-issue](../references/tasks/express-issue.md) needs [subagent dispatch](../references/shared/coordination.md#handoffs). Review follow-up leaves the PR open.
- Independent review: [review-changes](../references/tasks/review-changes.md) uses a fresh context and, by default, a different model recorded from runtime or dispatch metadata. See [Review](../references/shared/review.md).
- Board work: when a task uses a project board, select that board, use its actual Status options, and make sure the machine identity has writer access. See [Board status](../references/shared/board-status.md) and [Machine account access](#machine-account-access).
- Merge: [merge-pr](../references/tasks/merge-pr.md) needs separate, explicit authorization under [Authorization](../references/shared/authorization.md#limits).

Apply each [user-approved review exception](../references/shared/review.md#user-approved-exceptions) within its recorded scope. Report unavailable dispatch or model information. Self-review does not replace independent review. Direct operations remain usable without a coordinator, subject to their own requirements.

## Install the skill

Keep a full checkout of this repository.
A symbolic link is a path that points to another location.
From the source checkout, install personal symbolic links with:

```sh
python3 scripts/install-skill.py claude codex
```

A symbolic link points to the source checkout root. Source edits appear through the links without another installation.
The installer preserves correct links and refuses existing conflicting entries before it creates links.
It creates `~/.claude/skills/ghflow` and `~/.agents/skills/ghflow`.
OpenCode also discovers these compatible directories. See the [root-package setup trial](research/trials/2026-10-07-ghflow-root-setup.md) for tested discovery and limits.
If you use only OpenCode, run `python3 scripts/install-skill.py opencode` for its native personal directory.
Do not add a native OpenCode link when compatible links already expose `ghflow`.

For one target project, use `--project TARGET_PATH` with the agent names.
For an isolated personal installation trial, use `--home TEMP_HOME`.
These options change the link destinations, not agent authentication or configuration.
The installer does not remove older generic skill installations. Remove those links separately after you inspect their sources.
If you move the source checkout, replace its stale links manually. The installer refuses to overwrite them.

## Try a read-only task

After you install `ghflow`, start an agent session in a local checkout of the target repository.
The agent needs the installed skill and access to its source checkout.
It also needs permission to read the target issue and related GitHub records.

Copy this request:

```text
Use ghflow to reassess https://github.com/lmorchard/gh-project-workflow/issues/23. Return findings only. Do not edit GitHub records or implement changes.
```

The [reconsider-issue task](../references/tasks/reconsider-issue.md) returns current evidence, remaining work, and unresolved decisions.
The request forbids repository and GitHub writes. Issue #23 is closed.
If current evidence shows that it is resolved, a result with no remaining work is correct.

## OpenCode discovery limits

OpenCode can discover nested `SKILL.md` files inside the linked checkout, including Git-ignored worktrees.
Repository checks ignore worktrees, but native discovery does not.
The selected policy documents this limitation and permits root checkout links without an installer guard.
Inspect the installed source's worktrees for nested skill files.
Maintain worktrees through authorized cleanup, and preserve worktrees with uncommitted changes or an open PR.
If additional skills are unwanted, use a separate source checkout without nested skill packages.
The [root-package trial](research/trials/2026-10-07-ghflow-root-setup.md#nested-worktree-discovery) records the evidence and decision.

## Request another operation

Start a new agent session in the target project. Request an operation explicitly:

> Use ghflow to define issue #123. Produce a draft only. Do not publish or implement.

> Use ghflow to deliver issue #123 through review follow-up.

> Use ghflow to review PR #456.

Read [ghflow](../SKILL.md) for routing and dependency access.
The entry skill resolves the source checkout root and uses its absolute `cli/ghflow.py` path.
Commands preserve the target project's current directory.
It does not require the workflow checkout to be the current directory.

## Source access permissions

The agent needs access to the resolved source checkout, including `references/`, `docs/writing.md`, and `cli/ghflow.py`.
If the agent requests external directory access, permit that source checkout for this task.
A link does not grant tool permissions.
For Claude Code, `--add-dir SOURCE_CHECKOUT` includes that checkout in the session's allowed directories.
Codex's read-only sandbox allowed these dependency reads in the setup trial.

OpenCode prompts for external directory access by default.
For unattended sessions, merge this narrowly scoped rule into the target project's `opencode.json` after you inspect its existing rules:

```json
{
  "permission": {
    "external_directory": {
      "/ABSOLUTE/SOURCE_CHECKOUT/*": "allow"
    },
    "edit": {
      "/ABSOLUTE/SOURCE_CHECKOUT/*": "deny"
    }
  }
}
```

Replace both paths with the resolved source checkout.
This permits source access and blocks file-tool edits to it. Other tool permissions still apply.
The installer does not change agent permissions or write this configuration.
See [OpenCode permissions](https://opencode.ai/docs/permissions/#external-directories) for directory and tool rules.

## Machine account access

The repository owner grants access before an agent works in the repository or project board:

- Add the machine user as a repository collaborator with Write access.
- For a user-owned project board, add the machine user as a writer with `scripts/add-board-writer.sh OWNER PROJECT_NUMBER LOGIN`.

Resolve the script from the source checkout containing the entry skill. Do not resolve it from the target project.
The [identity reference](../references/shared/identity.md) supplies runtime configuration and credential handling.
The [identity research and trials](research/agent-identity.md) document records the adoption evidence and historical limits.
